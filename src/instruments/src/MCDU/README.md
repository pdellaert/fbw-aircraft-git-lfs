# WIP! Due to a recent re-structure of components this README should be ignored
# Multi-Function Control and Display Unit (MCDU)
welcome to the MCDU React rewrite!

# Components
refer to the components folder, every component as helpful JSDoc including it's props

# Examples
Refer to the INIT and FUEL PRED pages to see example usages of the components as-well arrow functions.

# Redux
The scratchpad, FMGC and titlebar are all stored in a redux store for ease of access in any component within the MCDU tree, it's hooks based so no need to use `connect`, refer to INIT and FUEL PRED for usages on interaction with the scratchpad, FMGC and titlebar.
