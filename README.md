The A32NX Project is a community-driven open source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible.

The following aircraft configuration is currently simulated:

 ```
 Model       A320-251N
 Engine      CFM LEAP 1A-26
 FMGS        Honeywell Pegasus II
 FWC Std.    H2F9C
 ```

Please note that this configuration may change in the future as the A32NX project evolves and changes.

## How to download and use the aircraft

To download the aircraft please go to the [FlyByWire Simulations website](https://flybywiresim.com). Please be sure to thoroughly read the [documentation](https://docs.flybywiresim.com) on how to install and use the aircraft.

If you're still running into problems after reading through the documentation, feel free to jump into our Discord [#support channel](https://discord.gg/snueqJjDUN).

## FAQ

### What liveries are available?

Liveries for the A32NX can be found on [Flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to). However, default A320neo liveries are not compatible with the A32NX.

### When is the next update?

We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each new stable version via [Discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire) and our social media channels listed above.

### How do I join the team?

Read [Contributing.md](.github/Contributing.md) and join our Discord to get started.

### Is the A32NX payware?

No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source.

### How do we report bugs?

Please read the [known Issues and bug reporting](#known-issues-and-bug-reporting) section.

### Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?

We have two versions: stable and development. The stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress and although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time.
