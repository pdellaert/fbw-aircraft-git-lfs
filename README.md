## About
The FS2020 A32NX Project is a community driven open source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in the latest Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible. It is an open source project and aims to enhance FS2020's default A320neo by improving the systems depth and functionality to bring it up to payware-level, and releasing it to the community for free, even perhaps making variants of the family (e.g. a319, a321).

## Installation
Installation is really simple. You only have to download the "A32NX" folder.

For the Microsoft Store edition AND/OR Gamepass edition:
* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community`.

For the Steam edition:
* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community`.

For the Boxed edition:
* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community`.

If the aforementioned methods do not work:
* You can find your community folder by going into FS2020 general options and enabling developer mode. You will see a menu appear on top. Go to tools and virtual file system. Click on watch bases and your community folder will be listed in one of the folders.
* Please make sure you're copying the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder, NOT the "msfs-a320neo-master" folder.

## Developing

The A32NX package only contains files which have been modified from the original package. If you wish to work on a file that isn't present in the development branch, simply copy it over from the latest Asobo branch. Please DO NOT add, modify, or delete files from the Asobo branch.

### Committing changes

After making any changes to files inside the `A32NX` directory, ensure you run the `build.py` script to regenerate the `layout.json` as necessary. There's also a CI check to ensure this has been done.
